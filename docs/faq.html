Why don't  you lobby to get the "aquaTerm.trm" stuff in the real distro of  gnuplot? It doesn't break x11 support -- it just adds functionality.</p><p>A: Right now, both AquaTerm and gnuplot development is in a state of rapid changes. The long-time goal is to have support for AquaTerm in the gnuplot distro. This of course requires the approval of the gnuplot maintainers and right now we rather focus on making AquaTerm a rock-solid app with support for as many languages/packages as possible. If you feel strongly about gnuplot support, tell them about AquaTerm and help us in pushing it into the distro. There has been some discussion on the gnuplot developer list that might be of interest.</p><a href="#topmenu" target="_self">[Back to top of list]</a><h3><a id="fink">Installing via Fink</a></h3><p>Q: I'm having trouble getting Fink to install gnuplot with support for AquaTerm</p><p> A: This is a question for the Fink users mailing list. Make sure that you can access the "unstable" branch of Fink. </p><a href="#topmenu" target="_self">[Back to top of list]</a></BODY></HTML>
